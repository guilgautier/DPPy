Welcome to DPPy's documentation!
================================

DPPy is in its early stage of development and is meant to become a Python library for exact and approximate sampling of Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs).

This documentation, for both the underlying discrete and continuous DPP models, aims at gathering:

	1. the main mathematical background and intuitions

	2. state of the art sampling algorithms through Python objects in the :ref:`tutorials`
