        L, and is then made valid when it is estimated using the Nystrom approximation. Afterward, the bound is never
        recomputed unless a loss of accuracy happens, which mostly triggers when the alpha rescaling is changed
        and the marginals must be re-estimated.

        included for debugging purposes and initialized to 0, to be later updated in the sampling loop.

        for debugging purposes and initialized to 0, to be later updated in the sampling loop. Each trial correspond
        to an alpha-dpp sample in the binary search procedure, and can accounts for many rejections. Multiple trials
        are necessary before deciding to switch the alpha value in the binary search.
        - result.rej_to_first_sample: number of total rejections until first valid sample is generated. This is included
